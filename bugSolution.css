While a definitive fix may depend on the root cause of the problem (which requires more detailed debugging), potential workarounds involve increasing the specificity of the `:visited` selector, ensuring no conflicting rules are affecting it, or employing JavaScript-based solutions as a last resort to detect and apply the desired styles based on the link's visited status.  Example using !important (use cautiously)  a:visited { color: purple !important; }
