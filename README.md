# :visited CSS Selector Issue in Chrome

This repository demonstrates a problem where the CSS `:visited` pseudo-class is not correctly applying style changes to visited links in Google Chrome.  Other browsers show the expected behavior.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS. The `bugSolution.css` file is for potential workarounds or solutions that might address this inconsistent behavior.

The problem could be caused by specificity issues, conflicting styles, or an underlying incompatibility between the browser implementation and the CSS code.

**Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and a robust solution.**
